Concept
=======

  When landing on a new machine(vm) with none of your cusomized environment
settings, pull this git repo and use the contents do 'deploy' your environment
into your new account.

how-to
------

* Place short instructions for configuration where scripted automation is less
  easy. 
* As items in this dir get more complicated, I would expect a how-to to evolve
  into a more automated/scripted process.
  
  
rc
--

* Those 'rc' files.  (rc = Recource Configuration)


bin
---

* Custom scripts normally deployed in the users ~/bin


sbin
----

* Scripts "internal" to this project that acomplish automation.
